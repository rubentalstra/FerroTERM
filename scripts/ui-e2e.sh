# The viewer's browser journeys: a headless Chromium driving the bundle a real

#   scripts/ui-e2e.sh
#   scripts/ui-e2e.sh --base-url URL --webdriver URL

#     --signed-in-base-url URL --issuer URL
#   scripts/ui-e2e.sh --docs-shots
#
# The battery must not change a tracked file. The documentation capture pass is
# the one exception, and it runs only when --docs-shots asks for it: it drives
# the same deployment and writes one PNG per viewer screen into
# website/book/src/operate/img/viewer, which the book embeds. An ordinary run,
# on a pull request or on a laptop, never rewrites an image.
#
# Without arguments the script owns everything it drives. It builds the bundle
# with Trunk, builds the server with the bundle inside it, builds the image
# from docker/Dockerfile the way the release lane stages it, and runs that
# image and a pinned Chromium beside it on a private container network. The
# journeys then run against the image the project actually ships.
#
# The signed-in journeys need a second deployment, because a server either
# configures an identity provider or does not and the read-only journeys assert
# the second shape. The managed mode starts that second server itself, beside a
# stub identity provider over TLS whose certificate authority it installs in
# both containers. In the manual mode you start the pair yourself and name them
# with --signed-in-base-url and --issuer; without them those journeys skip and
# say so. On a laptop that is:
#
#   cargo run --manifest-path e2e/Cargo.toml --bin stub-issuer -- \
#     --listen 0.0.0.0:18443 --issuer https://localhost:18443 \
#     --public https://host.docker.internal:18443 \
#     --name localhost --name host.docker.internal \
#     --ca /tmp/e2e/ca.pem --serve-name ferroterm-smart --serve-dir /tmp/e2e/certs
#
# then a server with FERROTERM_OIDC_ISSUER=https://localhost:18443,
# FERROTERM_BASE_URL=https://ferroterm-smart, a viewer client id, and
# SSL_CERT_FILE=/tmp/e2e/ca.pem; a Caddy container aliased ferroterm-smart
# serving /tmp/e2e/certs in front of it; and the browser container started with
# the authority as a Chromium policy. --issuer is the address the BROWSER
# reaches the issuer at, which is the --public one.
#
# With --base-url and --webdriver it builds and starts nothing and drives what
# you already have. Both are required together, because a browser that cannot
# reach the address is a red lane with no defect behind it: a browser in a
# container reaches a server on the host as host.docker.internal, not as
# 127.0.0.1. A server started that way serves the journeys' own fixture only if
# it was pointed at e2e/fixtures/codesystems with FERROTERM_CODESYSTEMS, which
# the tree journey needs and the capture pass needs on every screen.
#
# FERROTERM_UI_E2E_SHOTS_DIR sends the capture somewhere other than the book,
# for looking at a shot without touching the checkout.
#
# A journey that fails writes what it was looking at into
# target/ui-e2e-failures: a screenshot and the whole document, one pair per
# failed wait. A passing run leaves the directory empty, and the ui-e2e CI job
# uploads it as an artifact only when the run failed.
#
# A capture renders the FHIR base the viewer read, so whatever address the
# browser used lands in the images. The managed mode gives the server the fixed
# network alias below; a manual capture reproduces the same images by serving on
# 8080 and starting the browser container with
# --add-host ferroterm:host-gateway, then passing --base-url http://ferroterm:8080.
#
# The image stages linux binaries, so the managed mode needs a Linux host.
# Anywhere else it says so and stops rather than reporting a lane it did not
# run.
