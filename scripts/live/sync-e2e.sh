# One end-to-end run of the synchronisation on this machine, with YOUR NTS
# account: the server starts on an empty index root with its admin listener,
# ferroterm-sync runs once against the Nictiz Nationale Terminologieserver,
# the server reloads, and the report shows what it serves afterwards and what
# the run record says about every entry the feed offered. This is the first
# real run #602 asks for.
#
# Local only, by design: it reads a licensed feed with a personal account, so
# it refuses to run under CI and no workflow calls it. The binaries are built
# from this checkout and run natively; no image is needed. Everything the run
# writes lands under one work directory (default: a fresh temporary one) that
# holds licensed content and stays out of the repository.
#
# Usage: scripts/live/sync-e2e.sh [--work DIR] [--systems URI,URI,...] [--keep]
#   --work DIR     the work directory (index root, managed resources, staging,
#                  records, state, logs); default mktemp
#   --systems ...  the canonicals to subscribe to; default the NL edition of
#                  SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, and ICD-10
#   --keep         keep the work directory when it was a temporary one
# Credentials: FERROTERM_NTS_USERNAME and FERROTERM_NTS_PASSWORD, or
# FERROTERM_NTS_CLIENT_ID and FERROTERM_NTS_CLIENT_SECRET, as the add-on reads
# them. Requires: cargo, curl, jq, python3, and a free port 8080 and 8081.
#
# The FerroEHR hop comes after this: point its quickstart overlay
# (docker-compose.terminology.yml, [terminology.external]) at
# http://<this host>:8080/r4b and commit a composition whose binding names a
# code this run made available.
