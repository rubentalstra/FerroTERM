# The crates.io upload of the `crates/*` members, and its read-back, as one
# implementation shared by the `crates` leg of release.yml (a `v*` tag,
# approval-gated) and publish-crates.yml (a manual dispatch: the dry-run and
# recovery lane). The two lanes cannot share a reusable workflow: crates.io
# Trusted Publishing matches the OIDC `workflow_ref` claim, and for a job inside
# a reusable workflow that claim names the calling workflow
# (<https://crates.io/docs/trusted-publishing>), so the shared thing is this
# script and each lane keeps its own job and identity.
#
# Per crate, in dependency order, because `cargo publish --workspace` refuses
# the whole run when any member version already exists while being non-atomic
# at the end: a partial publish could not be finished by re-running it. One
# crate at a time, "already exists" counted as done, makes the lane resumable
# and idempotent; the registry is read back before success is reported.
#
# Usage:
#   publish-crates.sh publish   # upload each crate in dependency order
#   publish-crates.sh verify    # read the registry back, with retries
#   publish-crates.sh version   # print the lockstep crate version
#
# Requires cargo, curl, and jq; `publish` also needs CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN.
