# The resident memory of a built artifact, structure by structure (#322).
#
#   scripts/bench/residency.sh artifacts/nl [repeats]
#
# Runs `ferroterm-residency` once per structure per repeat, in its own process
# each time, and reports the median of the repeats.
#
# One process per structure, because two structures in one process cannot be
# told apart: the allocator does not give a structure back its own arena.
#
# The figure is the PEAK resident set of the process, read from `/usr/bin/time`
# the way this repository already measures an ingest. A reading taken after the
# load instead decays while it is being taken, because the allocator returns
# pages when it chooses: measured that way, loading the hierarchy AND
# transposing it read lower than loading the hierarchy alone, which cannot be
# true. The structure is read through a buffered reader, so the peak is the
# structure and not a copy of the file beside it.
#
# Several repeats, because the first read of a file behaves differently from
# the ones after it.
#
# Build the binary first:
#   cargo build --release -p ferroterm-bench --bin ferroterm-residency
