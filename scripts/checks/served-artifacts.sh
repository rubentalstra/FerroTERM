# Every artifact a run named is being served, checked before the run measures
# anything.
#
#   scripts/checks/served-artifacts.sh --server URL --index DIRS
#
# --server is a versioned FHIR root (http://127.0.0.1:8098/r4b). --index is the
# FERROTERM_INDEX the server was given: artifact directories separated by the
# platform's path separator.
#
# The server refuses an artifact it cannot read, logs the reason, and carries
# on serving the rest. That is the right contract for an operator with nine
# good artifacts and one stale one, and the wrong one for a run: a conformance
# count or a latency figure taken over a system the server is not serving is a
# result about nothing, and nobody reads the log of a green run (#493).
#
# So the run asks. Each named directory's manifest.json says which system it
# holds; the server's TerminologyCapabilities says which systems it serves. A
# system named here and absent there was refused, and this exits non-zero
# naming it. A system nobody named is never looked for, so an artifact simply
# absent from a run's configuration reads differently from one that was named
# and refused.
