#
# Every https://ferroterm.eu/fhir/StructureDefinition/<name> URL in the Rust
# sources under crates/ and app/ must have, under
# website/landing/fhir/StructureDefinition, a <name>.json StructureDefinition
# whose url is that canonical, and a <name>.html page. The site serves the
# landing tree at its root (scripts/site/assemble.sh), and GitHub Pages
# answers the extensionless canonical with the .html page, which links the
# JSON beside it. Exit 0 when every canonical has both.
