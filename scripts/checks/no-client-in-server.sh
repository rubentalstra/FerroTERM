# makes over `hyper-util` plus `hyper-rustls`.
# `reqwest` reaches the workspace only through the WHO ICD-API walker, which the
# offline build tool turns on with the `icd11/api` feature; a manifest edit that
# puts it back on a default path would restore the dependency with nothing
# saying so, and this is the check that fails instead.

# The resolved normal dependency tree is read, so a transitive edge is caught
# too. `hyper-util` stays: it is the health probe (one GET to the server's own
# listener over loopback, since the container base has no shell to run a probe
# with) and the SMART gate's read of the configured issuer. Exit 0 when the tree
# carries no client.
