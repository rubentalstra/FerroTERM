# Every pull request from a person records acceptance of the contribution
# licensing terms (CONTRIBUTING.md § Licensing of contributions).
#
# The terms turn a contribution into part of one work under one Licensor; a
# merge without a recorded acceptance is a line whose relicensing right was
# never granted. A checkbox in the pull request template is the record, and
# this gate is what makes it binding: a body without the ticked line fails,
# whether the box was left empty or the section deleted.
#
# Bots cannot accept terms, and their changes carry no copyrightable expression
# of their own (dependency and pin bumps); the workflow skips them by author
# type before this script runs.
#
# Usage: PR_BODY="$body" scripts/checks/contribution-licence.sh   (no arguments)
#
# With PR_BODY unset there is no pull request to judge, so the script checks
# itself instead: a ticked line passes, an unticked line and a body without the
# line fail. That is what lets the local gate battery run this gate rather than
# skip it, and what a CI run never does, because CI always sets PR_BODY.
