#
# A read costs a fixed amount plus the serialising of its answer, at a rate
# that is the same on every system, so the bar has that shape:
#
#   max_us = fixed_us + rate_ns_per_byte * answer_bytes / 1000
#
# A flat bar across systems would instead ask a 63 KB answer to serialise four
# times faster than a 1.5 KB one, which is a bar on how much a system has to
# say about a concept rather than on the server's speed.
#
# This reads records rather than running benches, because the claim is about
# what a real code system answers with, and the synthetic edition
# `bench-bars.sh` measures has no such answers. A record set taken before the
# harness recorded answer sizes is skipped loudly rather than passed silently.
