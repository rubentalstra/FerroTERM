# `addons/*` is optional by design. A source add-on is code the sync service
# compiles in and nothing else links, so the tree stays whole when an add-on is
# dropped and an add-on stays replaceable. Two edges would end that silently,
# and this is the check that fails instead:
#
#   1. a workspace member outside `app/ferroterm-sync` depending on an add-on,
#      which makes that add-on load-bearing for the server, the viewer, or a
#      library;
#   2. an add-on depending on a workspace crate other than the syndication
#      client and the leaf crates listed below, which ties one service's add-on
#      to the engine, to the server, or to another add-on.
#
#   scripts/checks/addon-boundary.sh [--self-test]
#
# Declared edges are what is judged. Normal and build dependencies count; a dev
# dependency is test scaffolding and is left alone. Rule 1 needs no closure
# walk: every workspace member is judged, so a member reaching an add-on
# through another member is caught at that other member's own edge.
#
# `--self-test` runs the rules over synthetic metadata instead of the tree: a
# clean workspace passes and each violation fails. It is how the local gate
# battery proves the guard still bites, and CI runs it beside the real check.
#
# Exit 0 when the tree is clean, 1 on a violation, 2 on a usage error.
