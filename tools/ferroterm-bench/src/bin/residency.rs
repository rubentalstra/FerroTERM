//! What one structure of a built artifact costs in memory, measured on its own.
//!
//! A served SNOMED edition holds more memory than its side files appear to
//! need, and a total says nothing about where it goes. This binary loads
//! exactly one structure and reports the resident memory that loading it cost,
//! so each figure is measured rather than inferred from a total (#322).
//!
//! One structure per process, because two structures in one process cannot be
//! told apart: the allocator does not give a structure back its own arena, and
//! a second load reuses what the first freed. The caller runs this once per
//! structure and the reader adds them up.
//!
//! The resident figure comes from `ferroterm_bench::memory`, which is how
//! every other measurement in this repository reads it; a process cannot read
//! its own memory without `unsafe` or a platform crate, and the workspace
//! forbids `unsafe`.
//!
//! `--report` answers the other half of the question. It loads everything a
//! served edition holds, in one process, and prints what each structure
//! reports it holds, from the structures' own `size_in_bytes`, beside the
//! process footprint. The difference between the sum and the footprint is the
//! residual, which the caller names rather than leaves as a gap.
