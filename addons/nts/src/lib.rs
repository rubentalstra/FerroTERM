//! The Nationale Terminologie Server (NTS) source add-on.
//!
//! The NTS is the Dutch national terminology service, run by Nictiz
//! (<https://www.nictiz.nl/publicaties/nationale-terminologie-server-handleiding-voor-nieuwe-gebruikers/>).
//! It is an Ontoserver deployment, so its downloadable content is announced in
//! the Atom syndication dialect `terminology-syndication` reads, and the whole
//! feed, including the listing itself, sits behind an OAuth 2 bearer
//! challenge.
//!
//! This crate is the service's identity and nothing else: where the feed is
//! ([`config`]), how a token is obtained and kept fresh ([`auth`]), where the
//! credentials come from ([`credentials`]), the one content correction the
//! service needs ([`fixup`]), and the [`source::NtsSource`] that implements
//! `terminology_syndication::source::Source`. Reading the feed, deciding what
//! a run takes, and fetching a verified content item all belong to that crate
//! and are not repeated here.
//!
//! The base URL is configuration, so a second Ontoserver deployment with the
//! same authentication shape is this add-on pointed elsewhere.
