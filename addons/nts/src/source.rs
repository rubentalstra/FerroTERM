//! The add-on itself: one configured service behind a bearer challenge.
//!
//! The service challenges both the listing and a download, and both carry the
//! same access token, so [`Source::listing_auth`] and [`Source::download_auth`]
//! answer from one authenticator. Reading the feed, applying the selection
//! rules, and verifying a download are the shared crate's; this type adds the
//! service's address, its authentication, its subscription, and the one
//! content correction its files need.
