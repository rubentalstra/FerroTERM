# Cutting a release

A milestone is a delivery promise, and a release is cut when its milestone
reaches zero open issues (`.claude/rules/issue-workflow.md`). The lanes that
build, sign, and publish are in `docs/ci-cd.md`; this page is the checklist the
cut follows, in order.

## Before the tag

1. **The milestone is empty.** `gh issue list --milestone vX.Y.Z --state open`
   answers nothing, or the owner calls the cut and moves the stragglers to the
   next milestone.
2. **The version moves everywhere**, not only in the manifests: the workspace
   `version`, `CITATION.cff`, the README, the landing page, the book.
   `scripts/checks/versions.sh` fails on any file left behind.
3. **The changelog names the release**: `[Unreleased]` becomes the version and
   the date, with a fresh `[Unreleased]` above it and a new link reference.
4. **The gates pass on the release commit**: `cargo fmt --all --check`,
   `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features`, `cargo nextest run
   --workspace --locked`, `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo doc`, and the
   scripts under `scripts/checks/`.
5. **The latency bars hold**: `scripts/checks/bench-bars.sh` measures the four
   operations over the generated edition and compares each median to the claim
   in `bench/bars.json`. CI runs it on every pull request too.
6. **The measured figures are refreshed.** Run `ferroterm-bench` over the local
   editions on one machine, copy the records into
   `bench/records/<date>-<machine>/`, and re-render with
   `scripts/checks/bench-table.sh check`. The Dutch edition's row carries the
   two figures a deployment plans capacity with: **the ingest time and the
   index size on disk**, beside the concept count and the peak build memory.
   The rendered footer names the FerroTERM version the records came from, so a
   stale set is visible in the published table.
7. **The crate line is publishable**: the `crate-version-guard` and
   `publish-dry-run` jobs are green (`.claude/rules/crates-publishing.md`).

## The tag

The signed tag is the owner's: `git tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z" <commit>` on the
merged release commit, then `git push origin vX.Y.Z`. `release.yml` takes it
from there: the draft release, the four per-architecture builds, the image, the
asset verification, the publish, and the crates.io leg behind the `crates-io`
environment's required reviewer.

## After the tag

1. **Verify as a consumer**: download a binary and the image, and verify the
   provenance and the SBOM attestations with `gh attestation verify` against
   the signer workflow (`docs/ci-cd.md`).
2. **Post the board status update** with what shipped and what the next
   milestone targets (`.claude/rules/project-board.md`).
3. **A bad cut is a new patch version**, never a retag: the platform freezes a
   published release.
