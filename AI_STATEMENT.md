| Status | Active |
| Author and owner | Ruben Talstra, maintainer |

**Abstract.** This document discloses how artificial-intelligence tools are
used to develop FerroTERM, an open-source pure-Rust FHIR terminology server for
SNOMED CT and other code systems such as LOINC. It states what the tools do
and do not touch, who is accountable, which controls bound the work and how
each is enforced, the licensing and data posture, the rules for contributors,
the uses that are prohibited, and the limitations that survive all of it. It
is a self-declaration by the maintainer, written for evaluators and regulated
adopters performing supplier due diligence, and it changes in the same pull
request that changes the practice it describes.

The key words **shall**, **should**, and **may** carry the meaning ISO/IEC
Directives Part 2 gives them: requirement, recommendation, permission.

## 1. Scope

This document covers the use of AI tools in developing everything in this
repository: the server, the SNOMED engine, the machine-generated FHIR layer's
generator, tests, tooling, infrastructure, documentation, and this document
itself.

It does not cover an AI system in the product, because there is none.
**FerroTERM ships no AI.** No model is trained, embedded, or called at request
time, and no inference happens anywhere in the served software. The server
answers FHIR terminology operations from precomputed index structures over a
licensed SNOMED release. AI is used to *build* the software, in the same sense
compilers and linters are used to build it.

## 2. Which frameworks apply here, and which do not

Stated plainly, because borrowed authority is worse than none:

- **The EU AI Act imposes no obligation on this project.** The Act binds
  providers and deployers of AI *systems* (Articles 2 and 3(1)); FerroTERM is
  neither, because it contains no AI system. Article 50's marking duties bind
  the AI tool's provider, not the tool's user, and the European Commission's
  Article 50 FAQ places source code outside the content-marking obligation.
  This document is voluntary.
- **Medical-device regulation does not classify this project as a device.**
  Under MDCG 2019-11 Rev. 1, software is classified by its intended medical
  purpose, and software that looks up, retrieves, validates, or communicates
  information without interpreting it for an individual patient does not
  qualify as a medical device. A terminology server that resolves codes and
  value sets is that kind of software. A downstream integrator who gives their
  product a medical purpose may bring *their* product into scope; that
  classification is theirs to make, and this document exists partly so they
  can answer their own supplier questions.
- **ISO/IEC 42001 and the NIST AI RMF are used as vocabulary, not claimed as
  conformity.** No certification is claimed, no audit has occurred, and the
  words "certified", "audited", and "validated" appear in this document only
  inside this sentence, to say they do not apply.

## 3. Terms

This document reuses the W3C AI Content Disclosure vocabulary rather than
inventing one: **none** (entirely human-authored), **ai-assisted**
(human-authored; AI edited, refined, or filled in boilerplate),
**ai-generated** (AI-generated with human prompting and review),
**autonomous** (AI-generated without meaningful human oversight). An
**agentic tool** is one that plans and executes multi-step work, editing
files and running builds and tests, under a human's direction, as opposed to
inline completion.

## 4. Accountability

One named human, the maintainer listed in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md),
is the author of and accountable for every change in this repository,
whatever tool produced the bytes. A tool **shall not** be named as an author,
co-author, or signer of anything here, because a tool cannot be responsible
for accuracy, integrity, or originality; responsibility that cannot be borne
cannot be assigned. There is no AI-issued sign-off of any kind.

## 5. Where AI is used, and at what level

The tooling is agentic AI coding assistance (currently Claude Code, by
Anthropic), operated in sessions the maintainer directs, reviews, and merges.
Levels below use the §3 vocabulary, per development activity. Deliberately, no
percentage appears anywhere in this document: no defensible method exists for
measuring one.

| Activity | Level | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Server, engine, and tooling code | ai-generated | written in directed sessions against the vendored FHIR definitions and the SNOMED CT / ECL specifications; reviewed and merged by the maintainer |
| Tests | ai-generated | held to the same authority as the code they test: expectations cite the specification, and the attribution discipline below governs failures |
| Documentation and this statement | ai-generated | held to the repository's own prose rules; the research grounding this document's structure is recorded on the project tracker |
| Specification adjudications, owner rulings, release decisions | none | decided by the maintainer and recorded with reasoning on the issue tracker |
| Contribution and review verdicts on others' work | none | prohibited use; see §11 |

**autonomous** appears in no row, and that is the point of the next section.

## 6. Human oversight

The maintainer directs the work, reads the result, and merges every change.
Nothing lands on its own authority, and no merge is automated. Where the tools
run multi-step sessions, the session's decisions with consequences (what a
specification silence means, what a wire behaviour must be, what ships in a
release) are the maintainer's, recorded on the tracker
([GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) § Where decisions are recorded). A decision
that exists only inside a tool session is not a decision this project made.

## 7. Quality controls, and what each one proves

AI-produced work is not a shortcut around engineering process. Every change,
whoever or whatever wrote it, passes the same machine-enforced gates. Each
control below names its enforcement, because a control without a failing check
is a wish. That principle is itself written down, in
[`.claude/rules/reliability.md`](.claude/rules/reliability.md), together with
the full enforcement register.

- **Specification authority.** The FHIR specification for the served wire
  version, the SNOMED CT URI and ECL specifications, and the pinned FHIR
  packages are the oracle for every spec-facing behaviour; spec-facing
  decisions cite the operation page or grammar section
  ([`.claude/rules/spec-adherence.md`](.claude/rules/spec-adherence.md)).
  Enforced by review against the cited text and by the tests below.
- **Executed conformance.** The HL7 `fhir-tx-ecosystem-ig` test cases run
  per FHIR version against a running server, and terminology answers are
  differentially tested against Snowstorm and Hermes over the same SNOMED
  edition ([`.claude/rules/testing.md`](.claude/rules/testing.md)). This is
  the control that catches a plausible-but-wrong implementation regardless of
  who wrote it.
- **Failure attribution.** A failing test is adjudicated against the FHIR and
  SNOMED specification first, and the implementation is never presumed correct
  because it was written carefully. A reference server is prior art, so a bug
  in Snowstorm or Hermes is not a requirement. Tests, fixtures, and
  expectations **shall not** be weakened to make a build pass; a fixture
  defect is adjudicated with a first-hand spec citation, never routed around
  ([`.claude/rules/testing.md`](.claude/rules/testing.md),
  [`.claude/rules/spec-adherence.md`](.claude/rules/spec-adherence.md)).
- **Generated FHIR layer.** The FHIR types and operation contracts are
  generated from the vendored, pinned FHIR packages; a drift check
  regenerates in CI and fails on any diff, and a `// @generated` file is never
  hand-edited ([`.claude/rules/codegen.md`](.claude/rules/codegen.md)).
- **Static and supply-chain gates.** No `unsafe` (compiler-`forbid`),
  deny-tier lints on panicking shortcuts, typed errors, machine-checked
  comment style ([`.claude/rules/comments.md`](.claude/rules/comments.md)),
  `cargo deny` policy, `zizmor` and CodeQL over the workflows, and SLSA Build
  Level 3 signed releases carrying SBOMs and Sigstore provenance
  ([`docs/ci-cd.md`](docs/ci-cd.md)).
- **A second machine opinion.** SonarQube Cloud runs on every pull request
  and every push to `main`; its findings are advisory, never outrank the
  specifications or the gates, and it commits nothing
  ([`.claude/rules/ai-code-review.md`](.claude/rules/ai-code-review.md)).

What these controls do **not** prove is stated in §12.

## 8. Licensing and provenance of AI output

The project is licensed under the Business Source License 1.1, with Apache 2.0
as its Change License. The position taken here follows the Apache
Software Foundation's and LLVM's published reasoning rather than wishful
shortcuts: an AI tool's output does not launder anyone's copyright, the full
provenance of generated text is generally not knowable, and prompting alone is
not treated as authorship. In practice: contributions of substantially copied
third-party material are refused however they were produced; generated code is
held to the same originality expectations as human code, under the same
review; and if identifiable third-party material is found in the tree, it is
removed or licensed properly, exactly as it would be for a human-introduced
copy. The tools are used under terms that do not restrict the output's use in
software licensed this way.

## 9. Data

No patient data, no personally identifiable health information, and no
customer data exists anywhere in this project. It is not in the repository,
the test fixtures, or the telemetry, and therefore not in any prompt.
**SNOMED CT content is never in the repository either:** SNOMED CT is licensed
by SNOMED International, the repository ships no RF2 release and no derived
edition data, and a deployment brings its own licensed release. Test fixtures
use shaped, synthetic content only, never real concepts extracted from a
release. This is a structural property a reader can check against the tree,
not a promise about tool behaviour. Vendor-side data handling is governed by
the tool vendor's terms; this document makes no claim on the vendor's behalf,
because such claims go stale silently.

## 10. Rules for contributors

Contributors **may** use AI tools. A contribution with **ai-generated**
content per §3 **shall** say so in the pull-request description: which tool,
and what it did. Disclosure lives in the PR description and never in commit
trailers, for two reasons stated openly. This repository's standing rule keeps
tool attribution out of commit metadata (one maintained disclosure beats ten
thousand trailer lines, and this document is that disclosure), and the wider
ecosystem has no agreed trailer anyway; the same trailers some communities
recommend, others forbid. The contributor remains responsible for their
submission in full, under the same [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) bar as
any other work: understood, explained on request, tested, and honest.

## 11. Prohibited uses

In this project, AI **shall not**: merge anything; adjudicate, score, or
answer reviews of contributions (the machine reviewer of §7 is advisory input
to the maintainer, not a verdict); sign anything; decide a spec-facing
question (silences are adjudicated by the maintainer and recorded); or weaken
a test, an expectation, or a gate to make something pass, the last being a
standing hard rule for humans and tools alike.

## 12. Limitations and residual risks

This section exists because a disclosure without one is marketing.

- **The gates prove what they test, not correctness.** The conformance and
  differential tests demonstrate the behaviours their cases cover; coverage is
  meant to ratchet upward and is itself reviewed, and it is still a boundary.
- **The reference comparison needs a licensed edition.** Differential testing
  against Snowstorm and Hermes runs against a locally provisioned SNOMED
  edition that is never committed, so it is a periodic gate rather than a
  per-pull-request one.
- **Review depth is one person's.** The project has a single maintainer;
  machine gates stand in for the review capacity a larger team would have
  ([GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) says this plainly). "The maintainer
  understands and can explain every merged change" is the honest claim; "every
  line was independently re-derived" would not be.
- **Retroactivity.** Commits predating this statement carry no disclosure
  markers; this document describes the practice, not a per-commit audit trail,
  and no such trail is claimed.
- **Provenance uncertainty survives.** Whether any generated fragment echoes
  unlicensed training material is not fully knowable with current tools; §8
  states the handling, not a guarantee.
- **The legal ground is unsettled.** Copyright in AI output is an open
  question in most jurisdictions; this document records positions, and
  positions may have to change. §13 names the triggers.
- **This is a self-declaration.** No third party has audited it. The checkable
  artifacts in §7 are the counterweight: they can disagree with this document,
  and if they do, the document is wrong.

## 13. Review and change

This statement is reviewed at every major or minor release, and revised
off-cycle when any of these fires: the tooling changes materially, a tool
vendor's terms change in a way §8 or §9 relies on, a binding rule emerges (EU
AI Act guidance touching this use, a foundation policy this project follows, a
court decision on AI output and copyright), or a claim in this document stops
being true. The maintainer owns the review; the change lands as a pull request
like everything else, and the version and change log update in the same PR.

## 14. Reporting

A suspected provenance, licensing, or quality problem in this repository,
including a claim in this document that does not survive checking, is a report
this project wants. Open an issue and cite this file; for anything
security-sensitive, use the private route in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). The
handling commitment is the same as for any defect: attributed, answered on the
tracker, and never silently absorbed.
