# The public roadmap board (GitHub Project v2)

The tracker is GitHub Issues (`.claude/rules/issue-workflow.md`); milestones are
the release spine; labels carry type + priority; native edges carry
decomposition/sequencing (`issue-relationships.md`). The **"FerroTERM Roadmap"
Project** (a GitHub Project v2 under the `rubentalstra` account) exists for one
reason: **outward transparency:** anyone can see what is planned, in progress,
and shipped, without reading the raw issue list. It is a **VIEW over the
tracker, never a second tracker.** This file is the policy (what the board may
and may not carry) and the canonical commands (the one sanctioned write path is
`scripts/gh/project.sh`).

## Owner-created

**The board does not exist until the owner creates it.** The repository owner
must create a GitHub Project (v2) titled **"FerroTERM Roadmap"** under the
`rubentalstra` account, with the built-in single-select `Status` field carrying
exactly `Todo` / `In Progress` / `Done`, plus a Date field named `Target date`
for the roadmap layout, and grant the working clone the `project` token scope
(`gh auth refresh -s project`). Until then, every `scripts/gh/project.sh`
command fails loud with "no project titled 'FerroTERM Roadmap'". The board
configuration intent (fields, views, automations) is at the bottom of this file.

## The one-datum rule

**Status (`Todo` / `In Progress` / `Done`) is the ONLY board-managed datum.**
Everything else the board displays is read straight from the issue and already
has a canonical home:

| Fact | Canonical home | NEVER duplicated as |
|---|---|---|
| Priority | `P0` to `P3` labels | a board Priority field |
| Type | `bug`/`enhancement`/… labels | a board Type field |
| Release | the `vX.Y.Z` milestone | a board Release/Iteration field |
| Decomposition | native sub-issue edges | a board hierarchy field |
| Sequencing | native blocked-by edges | a board Blocked column/field |

Do not add custom fields, iteration fields, estimate fields, or extra Status
options. A board-only fact has no backlink, is invisible to `gh issue`
consumers (the SessionStart dump, `/phase-status`, `/next-task`), and rots the
first time it disagrees with the label/milestone it shadows, the same decay
class `issue-relationships.md` §No duplication bans for issue bodies. If the
board ever needs to show a new fact, give the fact a canonical home on the
ISSUE (label, milestone, native edge) and let the board filter/group on it.

**The ONE sanctioned derived field: `Target date`.** The roadmap layout places
items only by date/iteration fields (milestone due dates draw timeline
markers, never item bars), so `Target date` exists as a machine-derived mirror
of the item's milestone due date. It is written ONLY by
`scripts/gh/project.sh sync-dates` (re-run after changing a milestone due date
or re-milestoning issues), never by hand.

**No fourth Status, no manual "Blocked/Stalled" column.** Blocked-ness already
has an automatic canonical home: native `blocked-by` edges (GitHub renders the
red "Blocked" badge on those cards by itself, and clears it the moment the
blocker closes). A hand-moved status would double-book that and keep claiming
"stalled" after the blocker closes.

## Status semantics + who moves it

- **`Todo`:** every open issue starts here (the auto-add workflow sets it).
- **`In Progress`:** set at pickup, when work on the issue actually starts
  in a session: `scripts/gh/project.sh status <n> in-progress`. `/next-task`
  does this as its final step. This is the ONE manual move in the lifecycle:
  GitHub has no built-in "branch/PR opened → In Progress" workflow.
- **`Done`:** never set by hand. The issue closes via the PR's `Closes #N`
  and the built-in "item closed → Done" workflow moves it. A reopened issue
  goes back to `Todo` automatically.

An issue abandoned mid-flight (session ended, work parked) goes back to
`todo` explicitly; a stale `In Progress` column is a false public claim.

## The one sanctioned command surface: `scripts/gh/project.sh`

Projects v2 writes (`gh project item-edit`) take four opaque GraphQL node ids
(project, field, option, item), never the issue `#number`. The helper
resolves them all from the `#number` and fails loud. Requires the `project`
token scope (`gh auth refresh -s project`).

| Intent | Command |
|---|---|
| Start work on #n | `scripts/gh/project.sh status <n> in-progress` |
| Park #n (work stopped, not done) | `scripts/gh/project.sh status <n> todo` |
| Put #n on the board (auto-add missed it) | `scripts/gh/project.sh add <n>` |
| Read #n's board status | `scripts/gh/project.sh show <n>` |
| Print the whole board by column | `scripts/gh/project.sh board` |
| Print the project URL | `scripts/gh/project.sh url` |
| Post a status update | `scripts/gh/project.sh update <on-track\|at-risk\|off-track\|complete\|inactive> "<markdown>" [--start YYYY-MM-DD] [--target YYYY-MM-DD]` |
| Read recent status updates | `scripts/gh/project.sh updates` |
| Sync Target date from milestones | `scripts/gh/project.sh sync-dates` |

Never move `Done` by hand, never `gh project item-edit` raw, and never
`item-archive`/`item-delete`; closed items stay visible as the shipped record.

## Status updates (the board's progress narrative)

GitHub project **status updates** (shown in the board header + side panel) are
the outward progress narrative. Post one via `scripts/gh/project.sh update …`:

- **At every release cut**: status `on-track` (or the honest alternative), a
  short markdown summary of what the release shipped and what the next
  milestone targets, `--target` = the next milestone's due date **only if that
  milestone actually has one**; never invent a date.
- **When direction genuinely shifts** (a milestone re-scoped, a program
  re-prioritized): post the change with the reason.
- Write for the public reader: no internal codenames, phase markers, or
  repo-internal file paths; numbers only when they come from committed
  artifacts. `at-risk`/`off-track` are used when true.

## Board configuration (the intent, for the owner creating it)

Fields: the built-in `Status` with exactly `Todo` / `In Progress` / `Done`,
plus a Date field `Target date` (kept true by `sync-dates`). Views:

1. **Board:** board layout, grouped by Status, sliced by Milestone; the
   "what is going on right now" surface.
2. **Roadmap:** roadmap layout, filter `is:open`; items placed by the derived
   `Target date` field; group by Milestone; milestone markers on.
3. **Current focus:** table layout, filter `is:open label:P0,P1`; columns
   Title/Status/Labels/Milestone/Sub-issues progress.
4. **Needs attention:** table layout, filter `is:open label:P0`.

Built-in workflows: Auto-add to project (`is:issue is:open` → Todo), Item
reopened → Todo, Item closed → Done, Pull request linked to issue → In Progress.
Keep **Auto-close issue OFF** (the board is a view and must never mutate the
tracker; closing happens only via the PR's `Closes #N`) and **Auto-archive
OFF** (closed items stay visible as the shipped record). Visibility: public.

## Interaction with the rest of the workflow

- **`/next-task`** moves the picked issue to `In Progress` once the plan is
  accepted and work starts.
- **`/phase-done`** verifies the closing issue lands in `Done` (the merge +
  workflow do it; the skill only checks).
- **`/phase-status`** may cite `scripts/gh/project.sh board` for the public
  view, but the issue list stays the working ground truth.
