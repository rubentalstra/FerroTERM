Read first-hand from
`tools/fhir-codegen/vendor/hl7.fhir.{r4,r4b,r5,r6}.core/package/OperationDefinition-ConceptMap-translate.json`
(2026-09-07). Use this to check a viewer spelling table without re-deriving it,
but re-read the JSON before calling a mismatch a defect.

**In (the request).**

| version | code | system | system version | target system |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R4, R4B | `code` | `system` | `version` | `targetsystem` |
| R5 | `sourceCode` | `system` | `version` | `targetSystem` |
| R6 ballot5 | `sourceCode` | `sourceSystem` | `sourceVersion` | `targetSystem` |

`url`, `conceptMap`, `conceptMapVersion`, and `dependency` are the same in all
four. R4/R4B alone declare `reverse`; the scopes are `source`/`target` in
R4/R4B and `sourceScope`/`targetScope` in R5/R6. Every `code`/`sourceCode`
documentation string says "If a code is provided, a system must be provided",
which is what makes a "do not send a half-named concept" gate spec-grounded.

**Out (`match.part`).** R4/R4B: `equivalence`, `concept`, `product`
(parts `element` + `concept`), `source`. R5/R6: `relationship`, `concept`,
`property` (parts `uri` + `value`), `product` and `dependsOn` (parts
`attribute` + `value`), `originMap`. `ConceptMapEquivalence` and
`ConceptMapRelationship` are different code sets, so a viewer must label which
element answered and never render one as the other.

**Not in any of the four base definitions:** `match.noMap`,
`match.sourceConcept`, `match.sourceComment`, `match.targetComment`, and the
top-level `used-conceptmap`. Those reach the wire through the terminology
ecosystem overlay (`tools/fhir-codegen/src/ecosystem.rs`, emitted into
`crates/fhir-types/src/r6/operations/concept_map_translate.rs`), so a viewer
reading them is correct and a reviewer checking only the vendored JSON will
wrongly call them invented.
