Work the current milestone to zero open issues without stopping to ask what to do next, then cut the release: bump the version everywhere, cut the changelog, open the release PR. The owner said it first for v0.0.4 through v0.0.7 and restated it on 2026-09-04 for v0.0.11: "keep going till there is nothing left in the milestone like the last one so we can cut a new release".

**Why:** the owner reviews and merges, and pushes the signed tag; deciding the order of issues inside a milestone is not something they want to be asked about. Pick by priority and blockers ([[repo-merge-gates]], the issue-workflow rules), state the order once, then execute.

**How to apply:** one PR per issue with auto-merge armed, the crate line bumped per PR, and each issue ticked and commented before moving on. New work found en route becomes its own issue in the same or the next milestone, never a silent deferral. Cut the release when the milestone empties and stop there: the signed tag and the crates.io approval are the owner's, unless they ask otherwise. See [[release-cut-cadence]], [[gates-in-container]].
