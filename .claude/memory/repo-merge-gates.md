The `main` ruleset on rubentalstra/FerroTERM requires: one approving review plus code-owner review, signed commits (the owner's GPG key signs by default), and the `conclusion` status check with strict up-to-date policy. Merge commits are disabled; squash and rebase are allowed, and branches delete on merge.

**Why:** Claude cannot approve or merge its own PRs, so work stacks: the next issue's branch is cut from the previous issue's branch and its PR targets that branch until the base merges.

**How to apply:** Open the PR, watch `gh pr checks <n> --watch`, tick the issue criteria, post the handoff comment, and tell the owner the PR is waiting on their review. `scripts/gh/project.sh status <n> in-progress` fails loud until the owner creates the "FerroTERM Roadmap" Project v2 (`.claude/rules/project-board.md`); mention it, do not work around it.


**Update 2026-09-03:** at the owner's request the `main` ruleset's approving-review
requirement and code-owner review were set to zero/off (temporarily) so PRs
with auto-merge enabled merge once the `conclusion` check passes. Signed
commits and the status check stay. Enable auto-merge on every PR
(`gh pr merge <n> --auto --squash`); the owner can restore the review rule
later.

**Rule (owner, 2026-09-03, "very very important"):** auto-merge only fires when
the branch is fully up to date with `main` (the ruleset's strict status
checks). Before arming `gh pr merge --auto`, rebase the branch onto
`origin/main` and force-push with lease; after any other PR merges, rebase
every open PR again. Never leave a green PR sitting behind main.
