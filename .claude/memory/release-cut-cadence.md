description: Cut the release the moment a milestone empties, bump the version EVERYWHERE, create the next milestone for stragglers, close the milestone by hand, and sign and push the tag yourself when the owner asks (done for v0.1.3 on 2026-09-12)

When a `vX.Y.Z` milestone reaches zero open issues, open the release PR right
away, then push a GPG-signed tag (`git tag -s vX.Y.Z`) after it merges so
`release.yml` publishes. The release PR bumps the version everywhere the
release is named, not only the manifests: root `Cargo.toml` (workspace and
path-dependency versions), `Cargo.lock`, `CITATION.cff`, `compose.yaml`,
`docs/VERSIONS.md`, `README.md` (image tag, roadmap list), the landing page
`website/landing/index.html` (JSON-LD `version`, the status line, the status
panel), the book `website/book/src/**` (install, verifying-releases,
introduction, comparison, examples, hardware-sizing, what-ferroterm-is), and
the `## [X.Y.Z] - date` changelog section. Run `bash scripts/checks/versions.sh`
before pushing: its "stale product versions" sweep fails on any lower version
string in those files (CI `versions` job, required).

**Why:** On 2026-09-02 the owner wrote "you did not cut an release from the
0.0.1 and now starting 0.0.2 already". On 2026-09-03, after v0.0.7, the owner
wrote "you have not updated all the version number everywhere": the README,
landing page, and book still said 0.0.6 after the tag was pushed, fixed in
PR #139 together with the guard.

**How to apply:** Check the milestone count after every merge report; if it is
zero, the next unit of work is the release PR. In that PR, `git grep` the old
version across the whole tree (excluding CHANGELOG.md and Cargo.lock) and run
`scripts/checks/versions.sh` before opening it. See [[repo-merge-gates]] and
[[milestone-autonomy]].

**Update 2026-09-12 (v0.1.3):** the owner asked for the whole cut, tag
included: "please cut the release for me please and close the milestone".
`git tag -s v0.1.3 -m v0.1.3 <merge commit>` signed with the configured
openpgp key without a prompt and `git push origin v0.1.3` started
`release.yml`; nine jobs, 33 assets, about eleven minutes. Do the same when
asked; otherwise hand the two commands over as `docs/release.md` says. Two
things nothing automates: the stragglers need a NEW next milestone
(`gh api -X POST repos/.../milestones -f title=vX.Y.Z`), and the emptied
milestone is closed by hand (`gh api -X PATCH .../milestones/<n> -f
state=closed`). Verify afterwards as a consumer: `gh attestation verify` on a
tarball (signer `release-build.yml`) and on `oci://ghcr.io/...:X.Y.Z` (signer
`release-image.yml`), and read the published image config through the GHCR
API with an anonymous pull token when Docker should stay stopped. Checklist
step 6 (fresh benchmark records) was skipped at v0.1.2 and v0.1.3 for want of
a quiet machine; #512 carries it.
