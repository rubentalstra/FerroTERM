//! The guard over `app/ferroterm-viewer/fixtures`, and the recorder that
//! writes them.
//!
//! The viewer's unit tests read those files with `include_str!`, so they pin
//! the viewer's capability reading against what this server sends. Nothing
//! else checks that the recording still matches the render, which is what this
//! module is: one test that fails when it does not, and the same test in
//! recording mode when the render changed on purpose.
//!
//! Recording is one command:
//!
//! ```text
//! FERROTERM_RECORD_VIEWER_FIXTURES=1 \
//!   cargo nextest run -p ferroterm-server -E 'test(the_viewer_capability_fixtures)'
//! ```
