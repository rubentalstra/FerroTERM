//! Reloading the served set: re-scan the configured directories, build a new
//! state, swap it in, and drop the old one when the last request on it ends.
//!
//! No FHIR specification governs a reload: our own design. The served set is
//! behind an [`Arc`], so a swap is a pointer exchange and a handler that took
//! the old state answers from it to the end. The triggers are `SIGHUP` and
//! `POST /reload` on the admin listener.
