//! The FerroTERM FHIR terminology server.
//!
//! The library holds the whole run path so integration tests can drive it:
//! [`config::Config`] names the artifacts, [`state::AppState`] loads them into
//! a registry, [`reload::Serving`] holds that state and swaps it on a reload,
//! [`router`] builds the `axum` application over it, and [`serve`] runs it on a
//! bound listener until the process is asked to stop. `main.rs` only reads the
//! environment and calls in.
//!
//! Every served FHIR version has its own path prefix (`/r4`, `/r4b`, `/r5`), and within it
//! the resource and operation URLs the FHIR REST API defines
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html>, <https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/operations.html>).
