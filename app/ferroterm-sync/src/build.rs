//! The RF2 lane: the offline build, run as a subprocess.
//!
//! A SNOMED CT release arrives as one archive, and turning it into the
//! artifact the server reads is what `ferroterm-build` does. The service runs
//! it as a child process in the same image, writing into a staging directory,
//! and renames that directory into the index root only after the build
//! succeeds. A directory a build is still writing carries no manifest, so the
//! server passes over it while it is being written.
//!
//! No FHIR or SNOMED CT specification governs this: our own design.
