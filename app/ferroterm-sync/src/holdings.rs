//!
//! [`terminology_syndication::select`] takes an entry only when the same
//! canonical identifier and version identifier is not held already at the same
//! feed date or a later one. Two places say what is held: the ledger the
//! service keeps of what it put there itself, which carries the feed date, and
//! the deployment's own directories, which carry the identity of everything
//! else an operator built or wrote by hand.
//!
//! An artifact or a resource the service did not write is held at the latest
//! representable instant, so a run never replaces it. Remove it to let a run
//! take that version again. No FHIR or SNOMED CT specification governs this:
//! our own design.
