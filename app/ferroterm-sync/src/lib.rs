//! The FerroTERM synchronisation service: one way from a terminology
//! syndication feed into a running FerroTERM.
//!
//! The service runs beside the server and never inside it. On a schedule, or
//! on a manual trigger, it lists every configured source, decides what the
//! deployment does not hold yet ([`terminology_syndication::select`]), fetches
//! it with its digest verified, and puts it where the server reads: an RF2
//! archive is built by `ferroterm-build` into a staging directory and renamed
//! into the index root, a FHIR resource is written into the managed resource
//! directory. The server is then asked to reload
//! ([`reload::AdminClient`]). Nothing is ever deleted except by
//! [`retention`], and the server's own write store is never touched.
//!
//! No FHIR or SNOMED CT specification governs the service: our own design. The
//! feed dialect it reads is the one `terminology-syndication` documents.
//!
//! The modules follow one run: [`config`] is the file that describes the
//! deployment, [`schedule`] and [`clock`] say when a run starts, [`state`]
//! remembers what already happened, [`holdings`] reads what is already served,
//! [`source`] is the add-on seam, [`build`] is the RF2 lane, [`activate`] puts
//! a staged release in front of the server, [`retention`] prunes what it
//! replaced, [`record`] writes down what happened, and [`admin`] serves that
//! record, [`metrics`], and the manual triggers.
