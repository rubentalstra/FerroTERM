//! The sources a run reads, and the add-on each one comes from.
//!
//! A source is an add-on from `addons/*` implementing
//! [`terminology_syndication::source::Source`], the subscription it runs
//! under, and the corrections its service needs on a FHIR resource file. The
//! service holds them as trait objects, so adding a national terminology
//! service is a new add-on crate and one arm of [`configure`].
//!
//! No FHIR or SNOMED CT specification governs this: our own design.
