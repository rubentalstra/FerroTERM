//! The one JSON post per run end.
//!
//! The service posts [`crate::record::Summary`] to the configured address when
//! a run ends, whether it worked or not. A delivery that fails is logged and
//! never fails the run: the run record is the durable account, and the webhook
//! is the notification.
//!
//! No FHIR specification governs this: our own design.
