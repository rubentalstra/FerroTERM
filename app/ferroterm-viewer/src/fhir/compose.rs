//! The `ValueSet.compose` a terminologist authors, and what the server reads
//! it as.
//!
//! `compose` is a definition rather than a list. "Multiple include statements
//! are cumulative", "within an include, all the criterion apply", codes named
//! by several `valueSet` references in one include are "selected for inclusion
//! if they are in all the referenced value sets", and "codes in the exclude
//! statements are never in the value set"
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/valueset.html#compositions>, and the same text
//! plus the worked union and intersection rules on
//! <https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/valueset.html#union-intersection>). Three
//! invariants bound what one include may say, and the screen states the one it
//! breaks by its own number rather than refusing silently.
//!
//! The model lives here, outside every component, so the composition rules and
//! the JSON the server receives are values plain unit tests can pin.
