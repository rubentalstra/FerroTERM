//! What a synchronisation run recorded about the deployment's own resources.
//!
//! No FHIR specification governs these records: they are the sync service's
//! own, and its admin listener answers `GET /runs` with the runs newest first
//! and `GET /runs/{id}` with one whole record. The listener authenticates
//! nobody and is never published, so the viewer reads it same-origin, which
//! means a deployment that wants these findings on screen puts the listener
//! behind the same address the server is served from. Nothing answers there
//! by default, and the screen then shows no findings at all.
//!
//! The record is read out of the JSON document rather than through a derived
//! decoder. The document is already decoded to a `serde_json::Value` by the
//! code that reads the resources beside it, and a derive over four more types
//! compiled another 6,898 bytes of decoder into the bundle for the five fields
//! a screen draws. Only those five are read: the record carries its counts as
//! pointer-sized integers, and WebAssembly is 32-bit.
