//! What the history screen shows: the versions of one resource, what two of
//! them differ by, and what a restore sends.
//!
//! Reading the versions takes whichever interaction the root declares. The
//! history interaction answers a `Bundle` of type `history` whose entries
//! carry the resource, `entry.request` and `entry.response`
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#history>); where a root declares only
//! the version read, the list is composed one `vread` at a time
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#vread>) from the version the resource
//! states down towards the first. A root that declares neither has no history
//! to show, and the screen says so.
//!
//! The difference between two versions is our own design: no FHIR
//! specification governs how a client renders one. It is a structural
//! comparison of the two JSON documents, path by path, so a reader sees which
//! elements changed rather than which bytes moved.
