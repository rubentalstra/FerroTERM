//! Authoring one local `CodeSystem` in the browser.
//!
//! The screen is the same for a code system this deployment built from a
//! release and one a person wrote here: the built one opens read-only, because
//! the capability statement marks it as served from an artifact and an
//! artifact has no write path. What makes the other editable is three facts
//! off the wire, and nothing the bundle assumes: the server states a
//! `meta.versionId` for it, the capability statement marks no artifact behind
//! it, and the token in hand carries the scope for the change.
//!
//! Every write is a create or an update of the whole resource with `If-Match`
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#concurrency>), so an edit made
//! somewhere else since the form was opened is refused with `412` rather than
//! overwritten. Nothing here deletes a concept: a published code keeps meaning
//! what it meant, and retiring it is the change that says so
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/codesystem-concept-properties.html>).
