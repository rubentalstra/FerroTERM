//! The value set composer: build a `ValueSet.compose`, preview it, save it.
//!
//! The screen is the editor bundle's own. It draws the composition rules FHIR
//! defines as they apply (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/valueset.html#compositions>),
//! previews the unsaved definition with `$expand` by `POST`
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/valueset-operation-expand.html>), and writes
//! through the RESTful API with `If-Match`
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#concurrency>).
//!
//! Nothing here names a code system. The systems come from the served root's
//! `TerminologyCapabilities`, the value sets from `GET [base]/ValueSet`, and
//! a clause selects with the filter properties and operators that capability
//! statement declares for the version it is over.
//!
//! Every control on the form is drawn by one of the four shapes below, whose
//! listeners arrive boxed. A control shape written once as a generic over its
//! listener is compiled once per call site, and this screen has forty of them
//! (`docs/viewer.md` §13, the bundle bar).
