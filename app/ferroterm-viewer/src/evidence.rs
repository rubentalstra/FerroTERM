//! The conformance and benchmark evidence this build carries.

//! Every figure here was read out of a committed file by `build.rs` and

//! record names the file it came from, so a reader who doubts a number can
//! open that file in the repository and check it.
//!
//! These are facts about the build, never about the deployment serving this
//! page. The screen says so, and the release below is the version the bundle
//! was built from.
//!
//! The evidence is a constant rather than a document the browser decodes. It
//! is fixed when the bundle is built, so decoding it in every reader's browser
//! would cost bytes for nothing and leave a failure the screen has to render.
