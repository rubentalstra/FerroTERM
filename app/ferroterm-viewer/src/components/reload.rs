//! What an authoring screen does with a refused write: the sentence its live
//! region announces, and the way back after a `412`.
//!
//! Every screen that saves states the version it replaces in `If-Match`, so a
//! change made elsewhere since the form was read is refused with `412` rather
//! than overwritten (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#concurrency>). The
//! refused content stays in the form, and one control, drawn the same on every
//! screen, reads the version the server holds now.
