//! What a screen draws where there is no answer to draw.

//! Three states, three shapes, the same on every screen. A reader who learns
//! one on the overview has learnt it on the runners.

//! Loading is `Reading`, which keeps the last answer on screen while the next
//! one arrives, and a refusal is `Failure`, which renders the server's own
//! `OperationOutcome`. The two below are the states with nothing behind them:
//! an answer that holds nothing, and a thing this root cannot do.
