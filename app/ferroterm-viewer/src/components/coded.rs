//! A control over a code of a value set the served root expands.
//!
//! Every coded element of an authored resource is bound to a value set
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/terminologies.html#binding>), and the editor
//! offers what the root expands that value set to rather than a list compiled
//! into the bundle. One control draws all of them, so a root that admits
//! another code offers it on every screen without a new build.
