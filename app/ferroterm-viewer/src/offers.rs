//! What a picker offers: the resources of one type this root publishes.
//!
//! A canonical is what every operation takes and what almost no reader knows
//! by heart, so a runner offers what the root holds rather than waiting for
//! one to be typed. The same read answers the version beside it, because a
//! version a reader can pick is one the root actually published.
//!
//! The read is the narrowed search in `fhir::named`, so offering twenty
//! resources and their versions costs four kilobytes.
