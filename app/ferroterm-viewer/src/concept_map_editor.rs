//! The form model behind the concept map editor.
//!
//! Everything here is plain values and plain functions: what a local
//! `ConceptMap` is while it is being authored, the FHIR JSON a save sends, and
//! the `Parameters` body a preview posts. No component reaches into it, which
//! is what lets the rules it encodes be pinned by ordinary unit tests.
//!
//! One rule shapes the whole module. A concept map is spelled differently in
//! every release this server mounts, so nothing here writes an element name of
//! its own: the served version hands over a [`Dialect`], and the dialect says
//! which element a target's relationship goes in, which element scopes the map,
//! and whether the version defines `element.noMap`. A form that wrote R4B's
//! `equivalence` on an R5 root would be refused, and one that wrote R5's
//! `relationship` on an R4B root would be refused the other way.
