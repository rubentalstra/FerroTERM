//! What a reader typed into the command bar, and what can be done with it.

//! The reading is of the string's shape alone. Nothing here asks the server a
//! question first, because the point of the bar is that a reader gets somewhere
//! before a request has been answered, and because a viewer that had to ask
//! could not offer anything on a root that is refusing.
//!
//! Every offer resolves to an address the reader could have typed, so an offer
//! is a link rather than a command.
