# What FerroTERM is

FerroTERM is a read-oriented FHIR terminology server for clinical code
systems. It answers the HL7 FHIR terminology operations over the code systems
you load, and every code system reaches the operations through the same
provider seam, so LOINC, ICD-10, RxNorm, and the rest are loaders and
providers, never special cases in an operation.

## What it does

The server exposes the FHIR terminology API on R4B:

- `CodeSystem/$lookup`: a concept's display, designations by language, and
  properties.
- `CodeSystem/$subsumes`: whether one concept subsumes another, from the
  transitive closure.
- `CodeSystem/$validate-code` and `ValueSet/$validate-code`: whether a code is
  valid, whether its display is right (the correct one comes back when it is
  not), and, for a value set, whether the code is a member.
- `ValueSet/$expand`: the members of a value set, paged, filtered by text,
  with version pins, over loaded, inline, and request-scoped value sets.
- `ConceptMap/$translate`: the targets a code maps to, from loaded or inline
  maps.
- `metadata` and `metadata?mode=terminology`: what this deployment serves.

## What it serves

| Code system | What you provide | What the provider answers |
|---|---|---|
| SNOMED CT, any edition | the RF2 release zip | the inferred hierarchy, preferred terms per language reference set, inactive concepts marked, the edition and version URI as `version`, the `is-a` and `in` filters |
| LOINC | `Loinc_x.yy.zip` | terms, parts, answer lists, and answers as codes; the FHIR LOINC properties and filters; `/vs`, `/vs/[LL…]`, `/vs/[LP…]` |
| ICD-10 (WHO and national translations), ICPC-2 | a ClaML document | the `classified-with` tree, modifiers expanded onto their leaves, inclusion and exclusion notes as properties |
| ICD-10-CM | the CMS tabular XML and order file | codes with the period, seventh-character codes under their stem, the `valid` flag |
| ICD-11 (MMS, ICF, the Foundation) | a local deployment of the WHO ICD-API | short codes, entity URIs, postcoordination expressions validated against the axes, the scale value sets |
| RxNorm | the RRF release or the prescribable subset | the FHIR `STY`, `SAB`, `TTY`, `REL`, and `RELA` filters over typed edges, `/vs` |
| FHIR `CodeSystem`, `ValueSet`, `ConceptMap` | a FHIR package or a directory of JSON | hierarchy, filters, properties, and supplements as the resources declare them |
| UCUM, BCP 47, BCP 13, ISO 3166-1 | nothing | grammar and registry validation, vendored into the binary |

[`docs/terminologies.md`](https://github.com/rubentalstra/FerroTERM/blob/main/docs/terminologies.md)
records each system's FHIR page, its licence, and exactly what the provider
implements.

## Why it exists

Most SNOMED CT terminology servers run on the JVM, and the reference server,
Snowstorm, runs on Elasticsearch. That stack works, and it asks for a lot of
memory: a machine serving an edition wants 16 to 32 GB of RAM, most of it
Elasticsearch heap, plus a search cluster to operate.

The data is smaller than that. The Dutch edition is 548,949 concepts, active
and inactive; FerroTERM builds it into a 591 MB index in 49 seconds and serves
it from one process that started in half a second. The goal is plain: run a
clinical terminology server on hardware you already have.

## Who uses it

FerroTERM speaks the FHIR terminology API, so any FHIR client can use it: a
validator, an IG publisher, a clinical application resolving value set
bindings. One such client is
[FerroEHR](https://github.com/rubentalstra/FerroEHR), a pure-Rust openEHR
clinical data repository by the same author. FerroTERM is independent of it.

## What is not built yet

The build order is the tracker's milestones. As of v0.0.6:

- ECL and the SNOMED implicit value sets (`?fhir_vs=…`) are v0.0.8; today a
  SNOMED value set is a `compose` with `is-a` or `in` filters.
- R4, R5, and R6 endpoints and the XML wire format are v0.0.9; the server
  answers R4B JSON.
- Hierarchical (nested) expansion, persisted client resources, `Bundle`
  batch, `ConceptMap/$closure`, and the SNOMED implicit concept maps are
  v0.0.10.
- MRCM validation of postcoordinated SNOMED expressions is not scheduled.
