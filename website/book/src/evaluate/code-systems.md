# Code systems served

One table of every code system FerroTERM serves: the canonical URI each is
served under, the versions and editions handled, how you bring its content,
and its licence position. This page is the single source; the README and the
landing page carry the same names, and a check in CI fails when a row here is
missing from either. The design notes per system (identity rules, filters,
properties, implicit value sets, with their citations) are in
`docs/terminologies.md` in the repository.

Every system reaches the operations through one provider seam, so nothing in
an operation is a special case for one system. The repository ships no code
system content, licensed or open: you bring the release you are licensed for,
and the build tool turns it into an index. The
[loading page](../operate/loading-snomed.md) shows each build.
