# Security Policy

FerroTERM is a read-oriented FHIR terminology server. This document says which
versions receive security fixes and how to report a vulnerability privately.

## Supported versions

FerroTERM is pre-1.0 and in active early development. Security fixes are applied to
the latest released version only; there is no back-port line yet.

| Version         | Supported          |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest release  | :white_check_mark: |
| Older releases  | :x:                |
| `main` (unreleased) | best effort    |

Once the project reaches 1.0 this table will name a supported minor line.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for a security vulnerability.** Report it
privately through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab.
2. Choose **Report a vulnerability** (GitHub Security Advisories).
3. Describe the issue, the affected version or commit, and a reproduction if
   you have one.

This opens a private advisory visible only to you and the maintainer. If you
cannot use GitHub's form, contact the maintainer through their GitHub profile
and ask for a private channel before sending any details.

Please include, where you can:

- the affected version, tag, or commit;
- a description of the impact (what an attacker can do);
- steps to reproduce, a proof of concept, or a failing request;
- any suggested remediation.

## What to expect

This is a solo-maintained project, so timelines are best effort rather than a
contractual SLA:

- **Acknowledgement** of your report within about 5 business days.
- **An initial assessment** (is it valid, how severe) within about 10 business
  days.
- **A fix or a mitigation plan** for a confirmed vulnerability as a priority,
  released as a new patch version. A published release is immutable, so fixes
  ship forward as a new version rather than by re-tagging.

We will keep you informed through the private advisory and, with your consent,
credit you when the advisory is published. Please give us a reasonable window
to release a fix before any public disclosure (coordinated disclosure).

## Scope

In scope: the FerroTERM server and libraries in this repository, its build and
release pipeline, and its published artifacts.

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies without a
FerroTERM-specific impact (report those upstream; Dependabot and `cargo deny`
track advisories here), and issues that require a already-compromised host or
misconfiguration outside FerroTERM's control.

## How releases are verified

Release binaries are built in an isolated reusable workflow (SLSA Build Level
3) and published with:

- a SHA-256 checksum (`.sha256sum`) for corruption detection;
- a Sigstore build-provenance bundle (`.sigstore.json` / `.intoto.jsonl`);
- a CycloneDX dependency SBOM (`.cdx.json`), and the dependency list embedded in
  the binary itself via `cargo auditable`.

Provenance can be verified with:

```
gh attestation verify ferroterm-<tag>-<target>.tar.gz \
  -R rubentalstra/ferroterm \
  --signer-workflow rubentalstra/ferroterm/.github/workflows/release-build.yml
```
