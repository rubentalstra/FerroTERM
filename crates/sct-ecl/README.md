# sct-ecl

The SNOMED CT Expression Constraint Language.

A `logos` lexer and a `winnow` parser faithful to the official ECL ANTLR
grammar ([the ECL specification](https://docs.snomed.org/snomed-ct-specifications/snomed-ct-expression-constraint-language)),
a syntax tree named after the grammar's rules, a printer whose output parses
back to the same tree, and an evaluator that compiles a constraint to set
algebra over a [`concept-graph`](https://crates.io/crates/concept-graph).

## Where it sits

`sct-ecl` is one crate of [FerroTERM](https://github.com/rubentalstra/FerroTERM),
a pure-Rust FHIR terminology server for SNOMED CT, LOINC, and other clinical
code systems. The crates are published so other projects can reuse them; the
API is pre-1.0 and moves with the FerroTERM release train. Documentation:
<https://docs.rs/sct-ecl>.
