//! Reads a LOINC release (the unpacked `Loinc_<version>` directory) into typed

//! lists, and the linguistic variants, each file located by name and read by
//! column name (<https://loinc.org/kb/users-guide/loinc-database-structure/>).
//! `ferroterm-build` turns this crate's output into the served artifacts.
