# loinc

LOINC release loading and the typed row model.

Reads a LOINC release (the unpacked `Loinc_<version>` directory) into typed
rows: the term table, the parts and the multiaxial hierarchy, the answer lists,
and the linguistic variants, each file located by name and read by column name
([the LOINC database structure](https://loinc.org/kb/users-guide/loinc-database-structure/)).
The crate ships no LOINC content; a deployment brings its own release under the
LOINC licence.

## Where it sits

`loinc` is one crate of [FerroTERM](https://github.com/rubentalstra/FerroTERM),
a pure-Rust FHIR terminology server for SNOMED CT, LOINC, and other clinical
code systems. The crates are published so other projects can reuse them; the
API is pre-1.0 and moves with the FerroTERM release train. Documentation:
<https://docs.rs/loinc>.

## Licence

Apache License, Version 2.0 (`LICENSE`). Clinical terminology content (SNOMED
CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, the Dutch national code systems) is licensed by its
publisher and is never part of this crate.
