# concept-store

The disk-backed concept store.

A [`redb`](https://docs.rs/redb) database holding one code system version's
concepts, displays, designations, and property values, keyed by dense ordinal,
that terminology operations read point-wise: `$lookup` and `$validate-code`
resolve a code here without touching the graph. Built offline, opened read-only
by a server. No specification governs the layout: it is this project's own
design.

## Where it sits

`concept-store` is one crate of [FerroTERM](https://github.com/rubentalstra/FerroTERM),
a pure-Rust FHIR terminology server for SNOMED CT, LOINC, and other clinical
code systems. The crates are published so other projects can reuse them; the
API is pre-1.0 and moves with the FerroTERM release train. Documentation:
<https://docs.rs/concept-store>.
