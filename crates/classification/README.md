# classification

Statistical classifications read into one model.

Reads Classification Markup Language (ISO 13120: WHO ICD-10, the national
ICD-10 translations, ICPC-2), the NCHS ICD-10-CM tabular release, and the WHO
ATC/DDD index into one `Classification` model: classes of a declared kind, each
with one parent, labelled and annotated by rubric kind. The crate ships no
classification content.

## Where it sits

`classification` is one crate of [FerroTERM](https://github.com/rubentalstra/FerroTERM),
a pure-Rust FHIR terminology server for SNOMED CT, LOINC, and other clinical
code systems. The crates are published so other projects can reuse them; the
API is pre-1.0 and moves with the FerroTERM release train. Documentation:
<https://docs.rs/classification>.

## Licence

Apache License, Version 2.0 (`LICENSE`). Clinical terminology content (SNOMED
CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, the Dutch national code systems) is licensed by its
publisher and is never part of this crate.
