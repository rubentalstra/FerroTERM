//! The [`Source`] seam: one syndication service, with its own authentication.
//!
//! A source is configuration plus an authentication scheme. The Atom dialect,
//! the selection rules, and the checksum-verified download are shared, so an
//! add-on states where its feed is, what it is expected to offer, and how to
//! authorize a listing and a download. The two are separate because the
//! services differ: some challenge the listing itself, some serve the listing
//! openly and challenge only the download, and some challenge neither.
//!
//! # The add-on contract
//!
//! An add-on implements [`Source::name`], [`Source::feed_url`],
//! [`Source::yields`], [`Source::client`], [`Source::listing_auth`], and
//! [`Source::download_auth`], and takes [`Source::list`] and
//! [`Source::fetch`] as they are. It overrides either of those two only when
//! its service departs from the dialect, and says so in its own
//! documentation. An add-on whose service keeps FHIR resources behind its
//! FHIR API rather than in the feed answers [`Source::fhir_api_url`], and
//! takes [`Source::list_api`] and [`Source::fetch_api`] as they are. The trait is object-safe, so a caller holds every configured
//! add-on in one `Vec<Box<dyn Source>>`.
//!
//! An add-on obtains and refreshes its credentials inside
//! [`Source::listing_auth`] and [`Source::download_auth`], which are called
//! once per request, so a token that expires mid-run is renewed without the
//! caller knowing that tokens exist. Credentials come from the deployment's
//! own configuration; nothing in this crate reads a file or an environment
//! variable.
