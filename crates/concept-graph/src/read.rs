//! Opening a side file for a structure to be assembled from.
//!
//! Every structure of a built artifact is read once, from front to back, into
//! the form it is served from. Reading the file into a `Vec` first puts the
//! whole file in memory beside the structure it becomes, and the allocator
//! does not hand those pages back the moment the `Vec` drops (#322), so a
//! reader assembles from a buffered file instead. No FHIR or SNOMED CT
//! specification governs this: our own design.
