# rxnorm-rrf

RxNorm Rich Release Format reading.

Locates the files of an unpacked RxNorm release (`RXNCONSO.RRF`, `RXNREL.RRF`,
`RXNSAT.RRF`, and `RXNSTY.RRF`) and reads them streaming into typed rows by the
documented column positions ([the RxNorm technical documentation](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/rxnorm/docs/techdoc.html)).
The crate ships no RxNorm content; a deployment brings its own release under
the UMLS licence.

## Where it sits

`rxnorm-rrf` is one crate of [FerroTERM](https://github.com/rubentalstra/FerroTERM),
a pure-Rust FHIR terminology server for SNOMED CT, LOINC, and other clinical
code systems. The crates are published so other projects can reuse them; the
API is pre-1.0 and moves with the FerroTERM release train. Documentation:
<https://docs.rs/rxnorm-rrf>.

## Licence

CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, the Dutch national code systems) is licensed by its
