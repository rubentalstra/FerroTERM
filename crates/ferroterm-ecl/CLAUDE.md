# ferroterm-ecl

The ECL lexer, parser, and evaluator. Hand-written; the ECL specification and
its ANTLR grammar are the authority
(<https://github.com/IHTSDO/snomed-expression-constraint-language>), version
pinned in `docs/VERSIONS.md`.

- The grammar in the parser mirrors the `.g4` rule for rule; a rule name in a
  comment cites the grammar section.
- A parse failure is the answer for a grammar probe and is the one sanctioned
  `Result` to `Option` conversion; a failure anywhere else is a typed error
  (`.claude/rules/reliability.md`).
- Every ECL operator gets its own spec-cited test case over a synthetic
  hierarchy; coverage only ratchets up (`.claude/rules/testing.md`).
