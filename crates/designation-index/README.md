# designation-index

The designation search index.

An [`fst`](https://docs.rs/fst) map over designation word tokens plus roaring
posting bitmaps per word, with language, designation-use, language reference
set, and status filters as bitmaps, sorted by term length then designation
ordinal. This is the `$expand` `filter` engine for every loaded code system.
No specification governs the index format: it is this project's own design.

## Where it sits

`designation-index` is one crate of [FerroTERM](https://github.com/rubentalstra/FerroTERM),
a pure-Rust FHIR terminology server for SNOMED CT, LOINC, and other clinical
code systems. The crates are published so other projects can reuse them; the
API is pre-1.0 and moves with the FerroTERM release train. Documentation:
<https://docs.rs/designation-index>.

## Licence

Apache License, Version 2.0 (`LICENSE`). Clinical terminology content (SNOMED
CT, LOINC, RxNorm, ICD, the Dutch national code systems) is licensed by its
publisher and is never part of this crate.
