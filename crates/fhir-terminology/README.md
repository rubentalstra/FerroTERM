# fhir-terminology

The FHIR terminology operations over a code system provider seam.

Implements `$lookup`, `$validate-code` (on `CodeSystem` and `ValueSet`),
`$expand`, `$subsumes`, and `$translate` in version-neutral terms over a code
system provider trait, so one engine answers every served FHIR version through
the generated [`fhir-types`](https://crates.io/crates/fhir-types) contracts.
Providers exist for SNOMED CT (RF2 through the materialized graph, store, and
index), LOINC, RxNorm, ICD-11, the ClaML classifications, FHIR `CodeSystem`
resources, and the IANA and UCUM registries; value sets and concept maps are
read from FHIR resources. This is the engine of the FerroTERM server.

## Where it sits

`fhir-terminology` is one crate of [FerroTERM](https://github.com/rubentalstra/FerroTERM),
a pure-Rust FHIR terminology server for SNOMED CT, LOINC, and other clinical
code systems. The crates are published so other projects can reuse them; the
API is pre-1.0 and moves with the FerroTERM release train. Documentation:
<https://docs.rs/fhir-terminology>.
