//! `ConceptMap/$closure` in the terms every served FHIR version shares.
//!
//! A client keeps a transitive closure table of the concepts it has seen, and
//! the server tells it which subsumption relationships hold between them
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/conceptmap-operation-closure.html>). The table
//! itself belongs to the client's session on the server; this module only
//! answers what relates to what, over the provider seam's hierarchy, so any
//! code system that declares subsumption maintains a closure.
