//! The compose layer: `ValueSet.compose` evaluated once, above every provider.
//!
//! Includes union, criteria within an include intersect, excludes subtract,
//! and a concept appears once per system, version, and code
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/valueset.html#compositions>,
//! <https://hl7.org/fhir/R5/valueset.html#union-intersection>). A flat
//! expansion answers in the order the compose selected: the includes in order,
//! each include's named concepts as it named them and each filter's concepts in
//! the provider's concept order, first occurrence winning. No version fixes an
//! expansion order, and `ValueSet.compose.include.concept` says an expansion
//! typically follows the compose, so this is our own design. Includes and
//! excludes are bitmap algebra; only the page asked for is read from the store.
