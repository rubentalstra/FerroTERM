//! The Necessary Normal Form of a concept, rendered in SNOMED CT
//! Compositional Grammar.
//!
//! The FHIR SNOMED CT page defines `normalForm` and `normalFormTerse` as the
//! "Generated Necessary Normal Form expression for the provided code or
//! expression", with terms and with concept ids only
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/snomedct.html>, "SNOMED CT Properties"). It
//! defines the property and not the generation.
//!
//! The generation is a rendering and not a computation. The necessary normal
//! form of a precoordinated concept is what the release's inferred view
//! already holds: "The inferred view is the necessary normal form of the
//! concept definitions, following classification", and it is the relationship
//! file that carries it (the SNOMED CT Release File Specification, Appendix D,
//! <https://docs.snomed.org/snomed-ct-specifications/snomed-ct-release-file-specification/appendices/appendix-d-concept-definition-illustrations.md>).
//! So the focus concepts are the concept's inferred `is a` parents and the
//! attributes are its other inferred rows, both of which the built index holds
//! as point reads. No reasoner and no supertype walk runs here.
//!
//! The syntax is the SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar specification, §5 Syntax
//! Specification
//! (<https://docs.snomed.org/snomed-ct-specifications/snomed-ct-compositional-grammar-specification/design/5-syntax-specification>).
//!
//! Three shapes are ours to choose, because no specification fixes them, and
//! each is marked where it is decided: the order of what is rendered, which
//! term a concept reference carries, and the layout.

/// The definition status prefix of a concept that is sufficiently defined.
