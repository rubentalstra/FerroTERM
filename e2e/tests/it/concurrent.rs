//! Two writers on one resource: a save over a version another window
//! replaced is refused, and the screen offers the way back.
//!
//! Every editor screen states the version it replaces in `If-Match`, and the
//! server answers a stale one with `412 Precondition Failed`
//! (<https://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/http.html#concurrency>). The stub issuer grants
//! only the authorization code flow, so the second writer is a second window
//! in the same session: it shares the issuer's cookie and none of the first
//! window's page state, which is where the token lives.
